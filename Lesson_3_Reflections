When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working with other users or using another computer that isn't setup with your git account (ie, public).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It could overwrite any data that you have saved locally without your knowledge.
