When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working with other users or using another computer that isn't setup with your git account (ie, public).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It could overwrite any data that you have saved locally without your knowledge.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks is a github clone of another respository. This is a feature only available to github and it essentially clones the other respository but leaves a link back to the original developer.

Clone is a one to one copy of the respository from git. It does not leave or give any indications to the original developer besides for the commit history.

A branch is a copy of the file/changes that are suited for different functions of the code and can be merged with a main branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Offline access. So that you can continue work when you don't have any internet access.
